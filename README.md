# Project Name: PCA and Clustering Analysis of US Arrests Dataset

## Description

This project performs a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering analysis on the US Arrests dataset, which contains statistics on assault, murder, and rape rates, as well as the percentage of the population living in urban areas, for each of the 50 US states in 1973. The aim is to explore and interpret the relationships between the variables and identify any patterns or similarities between the states.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer, along with the following libraries:

-   pandas
-   numpy
-   matplotlib

`pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn` 

## Usage

To use this project, you can clone the repository from Github and open the Jupyter notebook file "FinalCapstoneProject". From there, you can run the code cells and view the results of the PCA and clustering analyses.

The notebook contains detailed comments explaining each step of the analysis, as well as visualizations and interpretation of the results. Screenshots of the notebook in action are included in the repository.

## Credits

This project was completed by Joel Kenny as part of Hyperion Dev Data Science Bootcamp. The US Arrests dataset was obtained from the Kaggle website, and the original source of the data is the US Department of Justice.
